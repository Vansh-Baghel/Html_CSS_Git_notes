b) Relative units:- depends on web page or parent element.
	vw:- 1% width of web page
	vh:- 1% height of web page
	vmin:- minimum value among height and width will be used here.
	vmax:- maximum value among height and width will be used here.

* Box Model Styling:- Learn to write texts in box form.
	a) padding:- Gives space before the text starts from the left and right of the boc or the web page. Both side the distance will be same.
	b) Border:- Strong colored border to the text.
		Border itself is a big topic to cover. Basically 6 topics in border which you should consider before using.
			1) Border-width :- The border-width property specifies the width of the four borders in pixels.
			2) Border-style :- There are total 11 types of borders which you could give to the table.
			3) Border-color :- The border-color property is used to set the color of the four borders.
			4) Border-Shorthand :- Basically width, style & color written in same syntax. EG:- border: 5px solid red;
			4) Border-sides :- Can individually give the tpye of style of border on each side like top, botton, left, right.
			5) Border-radius :- Can make the border rounder in pixels.
	b) Margin:- Same like padding, just the difference is that the background color wont be seen into margin. Only if the parent tag ka color changes
				then the margin will be filled.
	c) Box-sizing-border box; :- Very important element to be used for whole html file. It will add padding & border (width,solid color) without affecting
								 the size of box. So if there are 2 boxes then both will be aligned even if one box adds any padding to the texts.

	visited:- Changes in color or etc will be made once we visit that link.
	float & overflow hidden:- Box model se bahar aajate h texts. It wont be seen unless u use overflow hidden. As the text is overflowed out of the box. 

** Styling Tables
* Table Border:- 
	2 types:- 
	a) Separate border:- Separate blocks. 
	b) Collapse border:- Joint blocks.
		Style to change these two types:- border-collapse: collapse; OR border-collapse: separate;
	c) padding:- To give spacing between the texts in the block of table. 
		th,td{padding:15px;}
	d) border-spacing:-  To give spacing between the tables.

* Specificity
	If there are two or more CSS rules that point to the same element, the selector with the highest specificity value will "win", and its style declaration will be applied to that HTML element.
	Also, the element written most recently will be applied to the txt.
	
* Controlling inheritance:-
	Unset:- Unset is a CSS value that's the same as "inherit" if a property is inherited or "initial" if a property is not inherited.
	Initial:- The initial value of a CSS property is its default value which differs with websites.
	Inherit:- The inherit keyword specifies that a property should inherit its value from its parent element.
	Default:- Default value of any element. eg:- link ka purple hota h. 
	Important:- Important ka specificity is the most, tag ---> !important.
	
* Controlling Overflow out of box:- 
	Overflow of text outside the box happens when the width and height of the box is small compared to text.
	To solve this, we use:-
	overflow:- Syntax---> overflow: scroll/auto/hidden/visible;
	-Difference in auto and scroll is that the box can be scrolled even after the width is sufficient in case of scroll, but in auto it'll not scroll.
	
* Controlling img out of box:- 
	Sytnax to fit img inside the box:- object-fit: cover/contain/fill.
